# JavaScript

Welcome to the JavaScript branch of my repository! This branch showcases a variety of tasks and implementations focused on JavaScript. Below, you'll find details on what has been accomplished in this branch.

## Features

### Data Manipulation
- Performed various data manipulation tasks to transform and process data efficiently.

### Array Methods Implemented
- **filter**: Used to create a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
- **map**: Applied a given function to each element in an array, resulting in a new array with the transformed elements.
- **includes**: Determined whether an array includes a certain value, returning true or false as appropriate.
- **indexOf**: Found the first index at which a given element can be found in an array, or -1 if it is not present.
- **reduce**: Executed a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.
- **slice**: Returned a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included).
- **splice**: Changed the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements.

### Fetching Data from a URL
- Implemented data fetching from a URL using `fetch` API to retrieve and manipulate data from external sources.
